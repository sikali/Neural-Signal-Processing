Neural Signal Processing



This is a simulation of an Event Related Potential with a stimulus flash at  ~ 1 s while recording EEG at a single electrode
  Stimulus presentation is repeated N = 20 times
  
  
  The data being used is attached (erp.csv) organized by 20 rows and 201 columns 
  
  
  
  
  
  File firsttrialplot.py
      PLOTS and shows the Voltage of the First Trial 
      
  File averageTrials.py
  
      Plots the average of all 20 trials
      
   File ttest.py
      Performs a t-test and finding whether the ERP is statistically significant at the first time point
      in the recording (t = -5)
